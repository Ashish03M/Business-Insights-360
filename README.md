## 🗂️ Data

The dashboard gathers and employs data from two main sources to provide comprehensive insights:

- Excel/CSV Files: This source includes critical information such as sales targets, market share statistics, and other related data. These files are regularly updated to reflect the latest figures and trends in the market.

- MySQL Database: This robust database stores both fact and dimension tables. The fact tables encompass detailed transactional data, while the dimension tables provide descriptive information. The combination of these tables enables in-depth analysis and reporting capabilities within the dashboard.

By integrating these data sources, the dashboard ensures a holistic view of the business performance and market dynamics.
